# Helper Scripts

## Compositer.sh

Shell script helps you use imgmagick to combine your png image sequences into a single filmstrip.

Depends on imgmagick. Easiest to install with homebrew on os x.

    bash compositer.sh

## as3/pg/FrameExporter.as

Allows you to simply export a png sequence or filmstrip directly from an AIR published swf. Works great directly from the Flash IDE with timeline.
